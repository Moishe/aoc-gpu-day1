This is an attempt to do day 1 of the 2021 Advent of Code on a GPU. I didn't do the whole data set, this is just a proof of concept, so I hardcoded the sample data.

The starting point from this project was copied from Apple's example of how to do [computations in Metal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/basic_tasks_and_concepts/performing_calculations_on_a_gpu).
